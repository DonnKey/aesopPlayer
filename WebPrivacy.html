Thank you for visiting the Aesop Player Website. 
</p>
<p>
The Aesop Player website provides visitors with anonymous access. You can access and browse our website without disclosing your personal data. 
</p>
<p>
The following paragraph exists for my protection. The thicket of regulation is such that even giving away something for free (but getting a rough idea of usage) requires being careful.
</p>
<p>
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, OR IF YOU LIVE IN A REGION WHERE THERE ARE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT THE POLICY DESCRIBED HERE DOES NOT MEET, THEN YOU MAY NOT ACCESS THIS WEBSITE AND USE THESE PRODUCTS/SERVICES.

<strong>Cookies </strong>

The Aesop Player website uses cookies. A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. These are used solely for statistical analysis in order to improve our services. They are not used to collect personally identifiable data about you.

<p>
<strong>What types of cookies do we use on our website?</strong>
</p>
<p>
To help us keep our website content relevant and up to date, we like to keep track of which pages and links are not only popular and performing well, but also those that aren't, so we can make improvements. It's also very useful to be able to identify trends of how people find their way through our site.

<p>
Analytics cookies are used to gather this information. The information collected is anonymous and is grouped with the information from everyone else's cookies. We can then see the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person's activity. Analytics cookies only record activity on the site you are on and they are only used to improve how our website works.
