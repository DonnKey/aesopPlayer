Project Goal
------------
Turn a regular Android tablet into a dedicated audio book player that can be
easily used by visually impaired and the elderly.


Assumptions
-----------
* used at home,
* focused on audio book playback, not music,
* controlled with imprecise gestures and subject to accidental touch,
* the user can see something but isn't able to make out letters or small UI
  controls,
* only a single function of the device (runs in kiosk-like mode, no access to
  other applications).


Status
------
At this point it's just an experiment.

The functionality is limited to browsing through audio books present on the
device (titles read out loud via Text-to-Speech), playback and stopping when
the device is laid down with the screen downwards.
