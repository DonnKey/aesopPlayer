Project Goal
------------
Turn a regular Android tablet into a dedicated audio book player that can be
easily used by visually impaired and the elderly.

Assumptions
-----------
* used at home,
* focused on audio book playback, not music,
* controlled with imprecise gestures and subject to accidental touch,
* the user can see something but isn't able to make out letters or small UI
  controls,
* only a single function of the device (runs in kiosk-like mode, no access to
  other applications).

Status
------
The main functionality has been implemented and the app is available in the
[Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studio4plus.aesopPlayer).

See the [website](http://donnKey.github.io/aesopPlayer/features.html) for details
on the main features.
