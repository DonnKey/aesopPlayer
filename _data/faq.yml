  questions:
    - question: Is it necessary to purchase an Android tablet to try the app?
      answer: >
        <p>
        No, you can install the application on any smartphone or tablet with Android
        4.2 or newer. You can also ask a friend who has an Android phone to install it so
        you can test it. The app can then be removed in a matter of seconds (like any
        other app).
        </p>
        <p>
        If there is absolutely no way for you to have access to an Android device you
        can install an app player on your PC or Mac, for example <a
        href="http://www.bluestacks.com">Bluestacks</a>.
        </p>
    
    - question: Is it necessary for the user to have WiFi or Internet connection after installing the app?
      answer: >
        <p>
        No. Internet connection is not necessary for running the application. The
        books are transferred from a computer over a USB cable so the device
        works more or less like any portable audio player.
        </p>
        <p>
        In fact I encourage disabling WiFi when "building" a dedicated player so that
        it lasts longer on a single battery charge.

    - question: I would like to make a Homer Player tablet but will I be able to do this with a Mac?
      answer: >
        <p>Yes, you can use a Mac or a PC with Windows or Linux.</p>

    - question: How do I rewind the book to replay a fragment I have missed?
      answer: >
        <p>
        This functionality hasn't been implemented yet. I will work on
        rewind/fast-forward soon since this feature is often requested.
        </p>

    - question: How can I start a book from the beginning? While I was testing the book advanced 10 minutes and now I want it to play from start when I give the tablet to my uncle.
      answer: >
        <p>There is a function to reset progress on <strong>all</strong> audiobooks to the beginning.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Start Homer Player.
        <li>Tap the screen 5 times to open Settings.
        <li>Choose "Rewind all books to the beginningâ€¦" and then confirm.
        </ol>

    - question: Can I put the audiobook files on a microSD card in the device?
      answer: >
        <p>
        The application scans all available storage types (both internal memory
        and any available SD cards). When it finds a folder <code>AudioBooks</code> in
        the top directory it adds all audiobooks to the list. This way books from an SD
        card and the internal storage are both available to the user.
        </p>

- section: Audiobooks compatibility
  questions:
    - question: What audiobook formats are supported?
      answer: >
        <p>
        Homer Player supports DRM-free MP3 files.<br>
        Each book may comprise of a number of files that are played in alphabetical
        order. The files may also be nested in subdirectories (useful when copying
        books that come on multiple CDs).
        </p>
        <p>
        This means that most audiobooks thay you <strong>buy</strong> will
        work fine.<br>
        However, subscription and rental services that only work with their
        dedicated application are unlikely to work.
        </p>

    - question: Where do I get books to listen to with Homer Player?
      answer: >
        <p>
        There should be a number of sources available to you:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Shops: you can buy books in MP3 for download or on CDs from many
            internet stores like
            <a href="http://audiobookstore.com">audiobookstore.com</a> 
            (you probably know the best shops in your country).<br>
            Look for DRM-free MP3 downloads.</li>
        <li>Libraries: it's often possible to borrow audiobooks at the local
            library.</li>
        <li>Free classics: there are many services and non-profit projects that
            provide free audiobooks (mostly classics).<br>
            Here are a few that provide books in English:
            <ul>
            <li><a href="http://freeclassicaudiobooks.com/">FreeClassicAudioBooks.com</a>
            <li><a href="https://librivox.org/">LibriVox</a>
            <li><a href="http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/">Lit2Go</a>
                (go to each chapter to download an MP3 file).
            </ul>
        </ul>

    - question: Can I use audiobooks from Audible?
      answer: >
        <p>
        Unfortunately subscription services like Audible are not supported and they
        don't provide MP3 files for download.
        </p>

- section: Installation on a dedicated device
  questions:
    - question: "When executing the <tt>adb shell</tt> command (step 8 of the instruction) I get the following error: <tt>device not found</tt>"
      answer: >
        <p>
        If you get this error on a Windows computer then it's probably a problem with a
        driver for your tablet. <a
        href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/android-wont-connect-windows-adb-fix-it-three-steps/">Installing a universal ADB driver should help.</a>
        </p>
    - question: "When executing the <tt>adb shell</tt> command (step 8 of the instruction) I get the following error: <tt>java.lang.IllegalStateException: Trying to set device owner but device is already provisioned.</tt>"
      answer: >
        <p>
        This means that there are some accounts still configured on the device.
        Make sure you have performed step "5. Remove all accounts" correctly.

- section: Supporting the project
  questions:
    - question: How can I help with the project?
      answer: >
        <p>There's a number of ways you can help:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="mailto:marcin@studio4plus.com">send me your feedback</a> so
        that I know what needs improvement,
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studio4plus.homerplayer" target="_blank">rate the app</a> to make it easier to find by others,
        <li>translate the Google Play Store description to your language, it's just a
        few paragraphs long and may help others learn about the app (<a
        href="marcin@studio4plus.com">e-mail me</a> for the English text),
        <li>tell others who might have a use for it.
        </ul>
        <p>Any help is appreciated, thank you!</p>

    - question: Can I donate money to the project?
      answer: >
        <p>
        Thank you, but there is no need. The project doesn't require much funds, it
        mostly needs my time and motivation.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you want to show your appreciation the best way is to send me a postcard from
        where you live.<br>
        Here's my P.O. Box address:
        </p>
