    - question: Is it necessary to purchase an Android tablet or phone to try the app?
      answer: >
        <p>
        No, you can install the application on any smartphone or tablet with Android
        4.2.2 or newer. You can also ask a friend who has an Android phone to install it so
        you can test it. 
        The app can then be removed in a matter of seconds (like any other app).
        </p>
        <p>
        If there is absolutely no way for you to have access to an Android device you
        can install an app player on your PC or Mac, for example 
        <a href="http://www.bluestacks.com">Bluestacks</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
        A new tablet or phone ("device") isn't necessary.
        An older device, even one without a cellular connection, is quite usable.
        See <a href="install-dedicated.html#hardware-selection">Hardware Considerations</a> for more on "previously owned" devices.
        </p>

    - question: Is it necessary for the user to have WiFi or Internet connection after installing the app?
      answer: >
        <p>
        It depends on how you want to use it. 
        <p>
        An Internet connection is not ever necessary for playing books.
        Books can be transferred from a computer over a USB cable, so the device
        works more or less like any portable audio player.
        You can also install from a USB "Thumb Drive", which allows you to install books
        at a location that has neither a computer nor an Internet connection.
        </p>
        <p>
        Books can also be installed via an Internet connection; in that case you will need some form of
        Internet connection, either cellular or WiFi.
        <p>
        The player can also be remotely administered if you have an Internet connection.
        <p>
        If you don't intend on using WiFi or Cellular on a Dedicated Player, turn it off to save battery.
        <p>
        There's a lot more on these topics in the 
        <a href="http:provisioning.html">Managing Books</a>
        section.
        </p>

    - question: I would like to make a dedicated Aesop Player but will I be able to do this with a Mac?
      answer: >
        <p>Yes, you can use a Mac or a PC with Windows or Linux.</p>

    - question: How can I start a book from the beginning? While I was testing the book advanced 10 minutes and now I want it to play from start when I give the tablet to my uncle.
      answer: >
        <p>This can be done from Settings &rarr; Current Books.
        <ol>
        <li>Start Aesop Player.
        <li>Enter Settings.
        <li>Select Current Books at the Bottom.
        <li>Find that book, and click on the time displayed at the right.
        <li>You can then set a new time (in minutes or hh:mm), including 0.
        </ol>
        You can also reset selected books to the beginning as a group from that screen.

    - question: Can I put the audiobook files on a microSD card in the device?
      answer: >
        <p>
        The application scans all available storage types (both internal memory
        and any available SD cards). When it finds a folder <code>AudioBooks</code> in
        the top directory it adds all audiobooks to the list. This way books from an SD
        card and the internal storage are both available to the user. 
        <p>
        For advanced use, it can look in other places. See 
            <a href="http:provisioning.html#audiobooks-directories">AudioBook Directories</a> for more.
        </p>

- section: Audiobooks compatibility
  questions:
    - question: What audiobook formats are supported?
      answer: >
        <p>
        Aesop Player supports DRM-free <code>.mp3</code>, <code>.mp4</code> and <code>.ogg</code> files.<br>
        Each book may comprise of a number of files that are played in alphabetical
        order. The files may also be nested in subdirectories (useful when copying
        books that come on multiple CDs).
        </p>
        <p>
        This means that most audiobooks that you <strong>buy</strong> will
        work fine. Books downloaded from the various free book providers should also be fine.
        <br>
        However, subscription and rental services that only work with their
        dedicated application are unlikely to work.
        </p>

    - question: Where do I get books to listen to with Aesop Player?
      answer: >
        <p>
        There should be a number of sources available to you:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Stores: you can buy books in MP3 for download or on CDs from many
            internet stores like
            <a href="http://audiobookstore.com">audiobookstore.com</a> or
            <a href="http://www.downpour.com">Downpour</a>
            (you probably know the best ones in your country).<br>
            Look for DRM-free (usually) MP3 downloads.</li>
        <li>Libraries: it's often possible to borrow audiobooks at the local
            library.</li>
        <li>Free classics: there are many services and non-profit projects that
            provide free audiobooks (mostly classics).<br>
            Here are a few that provide books in English:
            <ul>
            <li><a href="http://freeclassicaudiobooks.com/">FreeClassicAudioBooks.com</a>
            (choose the .zip format to get the complete book)
            <li><a href="https://librivox.org/">LibriVox</a> (uses .zip format)
            <li><a href="http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/">Lit2Go</a>
                (go to each chapter to download it in an MP3 file - you'll need to manually collate into a complete book).
            <li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/categories/2">Project Gutenberg</a>
                (Computer read - click on "More Files" to find a .zip of the whole book.)
            <li><a href="https://www.overdrive.com/">Overdrive</a>
                (If your local library is connected to Overdrive, this is a source for current books.)
            </ul>
        </ul>

    - question: Can I use audiobooks from Audible?
      answer: >
        <p>
        Unfortunately subscription services like Audible that use DRM are not supported and they
        don't provide MP3 files for download.
        </p>
        <p>See the previous question on some tips where to get books.</b>

- section: Troubleshooting
  questions:
    - question: When I browse books, the titles are not read aloud. How do I fix it?
      answer: >
        <p>The Text-to-Speech (TTS) module isn't working correctly.<br>
        There may be a number of reasons:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>voice data for your language is not installed,
        <li>your language is not supported by your TTS module,
        <li>no TTS is installed on your device.
        </ul>

        <p>Go to <strong>(Android) Settings &rarr; Language &amp; input &rarr;
        Text-to-speech output</strong><br>
        Here you can choose the preferred engine, change its settings (e.g.
        download more voices) and play an example sentence.</p>

        <img src="img/tts-settings.png" class="img-responsive center-block single-screenshot">

        <p>Most devices come with the Google Text-to-Speech Engine installed.
        It supports a number of popular languages. If your language is missing
        (or you don't like the voice) you can install other TTS engines from
        the Play Store.<br>
        One engine with a large number of supported languages is Vocalizer (paid). You
        can also find TTS apps for specific languages.<p>

    - question: Copying books to the device over USB doesn't work or aborts during the process.
      answer: >
        <p>
        A small number of users have reported issues with copying files to their devices.
        Here are a few things to try:
        <ul>
        <li>use <a href="install-dedicated.html#maintenance-mode">Maintenance Mode</a>
        mode while copying files,
        <li>if the device doesn't show up on your computer after it is
        connected, swipe down from the top of the screen (in Maintenance Mode).
        There should be a notification about the USB connection. 
        If it says "USB for charging" then tap it and choose "Transfer files".
        <li>if copying stops after a fixed interval, try keeping the screen on
        until all files are copied.
        </ul>
        </p>

    - question: I want to disable screen lock on my device but the "None" option is not available.
      answer: >
        <p>There may be a numbr of reasons for the <strong>None</strong> option to not be
        available.</p>
        <p>
        The most common is that there is more than one account set up on the device, usually
        a guest account. Delete the account to bring back the "None" screen lock option.
        </p>
        <p>
        Removing a user account differs slightly between devices, but usually one needs
        to switch to the account to delete, go to <strong>(Android)Settings</strong> &rarr;
        <strong>Users</strong> and remove the current account.<br>
        If you need more specific information for your device Google for: <a
        href="https://www.google.com/search?q=android+remove+guest+account" target="_blank">Android
        remove guest account <em>your phone make</em></a>.

  questions:
    - question: How can I help with the project?
      answer: >
        <p>There's a number of ways you can help:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="mailto:aesopPlayer@gmail.com">send me your feedback</a> 
        so that I know what needs improvement,
        <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.donnKey.aesopPlayer" target="_blank"> rate the app</a> 
        to make it easier to find by others,
        <li>translate the Google Play Store description to your language, it's just a
        few paragraphs long and may help others learn about the app
        (<a href="mailto:aesopPlayer@gmail.com">e-mail me</a> for the English text),
        <li>localize (translate) the app's messages,
        <li>translate this Web page (for the very ambitious),
        <li>tell others who might have a use for it.
        </ul>
        <p>Any help is appreciated, thank you!</p>

    - question: Can I donate money to the project?
      answer: >
        <p>
        Thank you, but there is no need.
        The project doesn't require much money; it mostly needs my time and motivation.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, the various volunteer book providers like LibriVox and Project Gutenberg can use financial help 
        (so there are more books to read!)
        Consider donating to the ones you use. I do.
        Letting me know <a href="mailto:aesopPlayer@gmail.com">by mail</a> 
        you did that is always nice, or make the donation in the name of "Aesop Player".
        <p>
        This project is based upon the
        <a href="https://msimonides.github.io/homerplayer">Homer Player</a>
        project created by Marcin Simonides. Our thanks to him.
