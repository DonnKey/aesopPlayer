<p>
Here are the exact step needed to turn a tablet into a <strong>single-purpose audio
book player</strong> (if you only wish to test the app,
<a href="install-test.html">go here</a>).
</p>

<p>
This guide is aimed at tech savvy people at this moment but I'm working on
making installation easier.<br>
If you get stuck <a href="mailto:marcin@studio4plus.com"

</p>

</p>

<h2>1. Factory reset</h2>

<p>
It's recommended to remove all unnecesary software by performing a factory reset.<br>
<strong>This step will delete all data on the device</strong> (but that's the goal :) ).
</p>

<p>
Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &rarr; <strong>Backup & reset</strong> &rarr;
<strong>Factory data reset</strong>.
</p>

<h2>2. Set language and download voice data</h2>

<p>
First make sure to set the device language to your language (the one audiobook
titles are going to be in).
</p>

<p>
Next enable WiFi and download text-to-speech voice data for your language.
Text-to-speech is used by Homer Player to read book titles.

<h2>3. Install Homer Player</h2>

<p>
Install the app from the
<a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studio4plus.homerplayer"
	onclick="gaLinkClick('Play Store')">Google Play Store</a>.
</p>

<h2>4. Disable WiFi</h2>

<p>
Disable WiFi so that it doesn't drain the battery.<br>
If you haven't performed a factory reset, disable all unnecessary applications
that may be running in the background.
</p>

<h2>5. Remove all accounts</h2>

<p>
In order for step 8 to succeed, you need to remove all the accounts registered
in the system.
</p>

<p>
Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &rarr; <strong>Accounts</strong> and remove all
the accounts.
</p>

<h2>6. Install ADB</h2>

<p>
The <code>adb</code> command is needed to perform the next step. The software installed
here can be uninstalled later.
</p>

<ul id="adb-install-tabs" class="nav nav-tabs" data-tabs="adb-install-tab-content">
  <li class="active"><a href="#adb-install-windows" data-toggle="tab">Windows</a></li>
  <li><a href="#adb-install-ubuntu" data-toggle="tab">Ubuntu</a></li>
  <li><a href="#adb-install-other" data-toggle="tab">Other</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="tab-content tab-content-framed">
  <div id="adb-install-windows" class="tab-pane active">
  <p>
  Download and install the (unofficial) package from
  <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2588979" target="_blank">this post</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you prefer, you can of course install the
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other" target="_blank">Android SDK Tools</a>
  or even Android Studio but it's a bigger download and more work.
  </p>
  </div>
  
  <div id="adb-install-ubuntu" class="tab-pane">
  <p>
  Install <code>adb</code> with the following command:
  </p>
  <blockquote><code>sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb</code></blockquote>
  </div>

  <div id="adb-install-other" class="tab-pane">
  <p>
  Download and install the
  <a href="https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other" target="_blank">Android SDK Tools</a>.
  </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2>7. Enable USB debugging</h2>

<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &rarr; <strong>About tablet</strong> and
tap on the <strong>Build number</strong> 7 times.
<li>Go back, enter the newly added <strong>Developer options</strong> and
activate <strong>USB debugging</strong>.
</ol>

<p>You are a hacker now ;)</p>

<h2>8. Make Homer Player a privileged application</h2>

<p>
In order for Homer Player to take full control of the UI it needs to be given
special privilege - it needs to be made a so-called <em>device owner</em>.
This doesn't change the software in any way, it does <strong>not</strong>
void the warranty and it can be easily reversed.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Attach the device with a USB cable to your computer.
<li>Start a terminal (Linux/Mac) or the command prompt (Windows).
<li>Execute the following command (on one line):
<blockquote>
<code>adb shell dpm set-device-owner com.studio4plus.homerplayer/.HomerPlayerDeviceAdmin</code>
</blockquote>
</ol>

<p>
You should see:
<pre>
Success: Device owner set to package com.studio4plus.homerplayer
</pre>
If you don't, make sure you have performed step 6 above.
</p>


<h2>9. Enable the kiosk mode</h2>

<ol>
<li>Start Homer Player.
<li>Tap 5 times on the screen to enter settings.
<li>Enable "Prevent from exiting the application (kiosk mode)".
<li>Go back to leave the settings screen.
</ol>

<img src="img/kiosk-mode.png" class="center-block img-responsive">

Now it's impossible to leave the player application (you can revert it by
repeating the above steps and disabling that option).

<h2>10. Copy audiobooks to the device</h2>

<p>
All you have to do now is copy some audiobooks and you're ready.
</p>

{% include copying_audiobooks.html %}

<h2>11. The final touch</h2>

<p>
If you want to make it easier to operate the device you can mark the
buttons with color sticker paper or put it in a "smart cover" (one that
automatically activates the tablet when opened).
