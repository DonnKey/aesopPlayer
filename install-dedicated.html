<p>
Homer Player can be installed as the only application available to the user.
This way there is no risk that the user leaves the player and doesn't know how
to start it again.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>An Android tablet with <strong>Android 5.0</strong> or newer.</li>
<li>(optional) A "smart cover" that activates the device when it's opened.</li>
<li>Access to a PC or Mac.</li>
<li>About <strong>30 minutes</strong> of your time.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Any tablet should do fine as long as Android 5.0 is installed. It's best that it
doesn't have any other buttons than power and volume as they would only get in
the way (e.g. hardware "home" button). Other than that there are no special
hardware requirements.
</p>

<p>
At the time of this writing the cheaper tablets are offered with older Android
versions but this is likely to change soon.
For the time being I can recommend a used Nexus 7. The older 2012 model
<a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_odkw=nexus+7+2012&_osacat=0&_from=R40&_nkw=nexus+7+2012&_sacat=171485">can be obtained for under $80</a>. And it supports smart covers.
