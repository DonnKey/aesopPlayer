<h1>Data Use Policy</h1>


<p>
    The Aesop Player (“App”) is offered as a free application in the hope that it will be useful. It does not collect personal information, and does not support any advertising.
</p>
<p>
    If you have enabled the appropriate option, the App  automatically collects certain usage and device data for the purpose of improving the App and its user experience. Such usage and device data do not contain any personal information.
</p>
<p>
    During the application initialization, or later from the main Settings screen, you will have the option to either authorize such data collection or not. Assuming you have authorized it, the following data is collected when you use the App. If you have not authorized it, no data is collected or transmitted. That option has no other effect on the operation of the program.
</p>
<h2>Usage information</h2>


<p>
    This collects information about how often the App is being used or which application features are used. This data contains no personally identifiable information. This data is processed by the third-party service provider Google using their Firebase Analytics tool. Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics share a unique identifier that is not traceable to your device and which can be reset at any time.  Only Firebase Analytics retains any of this information; we occasionally inspect that data in aggregate to identify trends but keep no copies. User provided variable information (for example, book titles) is never uploaded.
</p>
<h2>Stability monitoring</h2>


<p>
    This is data about application errors that cause the application to stop (so called "crashes"). Whenever such an error occurs data about the application state at that moment is collected, as well as data about whether certain features had been used prior to the crash. This data is processed by the third-party service provider Google using their Firebase Crashlytics tool. Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics share a unique identifier that is not traceable to your device and which can be reset at any time. Only Firebase Crashlytics retains any of this information; we inspect that data to understand failures, but keep no copies. User provided variable information (for example, book titles) is never uploaded.
</p>
<h2>Device data</h2>


<p>
    Both usage and stability monitoring collects data about the device on which the application is running. The data consists of make and model of the device, technical specification such as screen resolution, amount of memory and some state of the device, e.g. the current amount of free memory.
</p>
