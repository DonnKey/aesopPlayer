<h2>1. Requirements</h2>

<p>
You need a smartphone or a tablet ("device") running Android, preferably Android 5.0 or newer.
<br>
You can also run the app on Android 4.2+ and the Kindle Fire tablets but there
will be some limitations when making a <i>dedicated player</i>.
</p>
<p>
The Aesop Player has features for making a 
<a href="install-dedicated.html">dedicated player</a>,
one that will do nothing but be an audiobook player.
That's completely optional and unless you set that up it's just like any other application.
</p>

<p>
An Internet connection is needed during installation but it is not necessary
when listening to audiobooks. See 
<a href="install-dedicated.html#hardware-selection">Hardware Considerations</a>
for more on hardware requirements, particularly if you are making a dedicated player.
</p>

<h2 id=installing class="anchor-target">2. Install Aesop Player</h2>
<p>
<!-- fix link below to work ??????????  Or rewrite to do it on a 'phone! -->
Open the 
	<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.donnKey.aesopPlayer&referrer=utm_source%3Dwebsite%26utm_term%3Dtest"
	onclick="gaLinkClick('Play Store')">Play Store</a> 
app on your device,
search for "Aesop Player" and tap "Install".
It will ask for various permissions (so it can access books and adjust its settings). Grant them.
<!-- ??????????????? href here -->
</p>
<p>
If your device doesn't have the Google Play Store (e.g. Kindle Fire), you can
download the Aesop installation APK file directly from <a
	href="https://goo.gl/XJhKX7" onclick="gaLinkClick('github
	releases')">https://goo.gl/XJhKX7</a>.
Open the downloaded file on your device to install.
<!-- fix above link to be for Aesop ?????????? -->
</p>

<h2>3. Open Aesop Player</h2>

<div class="center-block photo" style="max-width: 376px">
<img class="img-responsive center-block" src="img/tts-intent-prompt.png">
Text-to-Speech engine selection.
</div>
<p>
The first time you open Aesop Player you may be prompted to choose a
Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine. Choose one (Google is a safe bet - this can be
changed later) and tap "Always".
</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is used by Aesop Player to read audiobook titles. If it
doesn't work, check the <a
href="faq.html#when-i-browse-books-the-titles-are-not-read-aloud-how-do-i-fix-it">FAQ</a> for help.</p>

<h2>4. Play with the app</h2>
<p>
Aesop will prompt you to download sample audiobook excerpts from within the app so that you can
start testing it right away. These are short and will only take a few moments to download and install.
</p>

<p>
Play, pause, swipe left and right to change books, test flip-to-stop and <a
  href="features.html">other features</a>.
Settings is entered by tapping the "gear" icon. There is a setting (disabled when first installed) to
make it hard to accidentally enter settings. See the 
<a href="install-dedicated.html#access-to-settings">Controlling Unintended Access to Settings</a>
for details.
See <a href="install-configure.html">Configuation Guide</a> for other configuration information.

<h2 id=provisioning class="anchor-target">5. Install audiobooks to the device</h2>

<p>
There are a number of ways to install audiobooks on Aesop. Some involve the use of a computer,
some involve using the Internet, and there are other ways. As an example, here's a way that 
doesn't require anything but your device and an Internet connection.
There's a detailed discussion of other alternatives
<a href="provisioning.html">here</a>. 
(If you have a very slow or expensive Internet connection, look at one of the other alternatives,
audiobooks tend to be fairly large.)
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
	Choose a free (no DRM) Internet audiobook provider as suggested in the
	<a href="faq.html#where-do-i-get-books-to-listen-to-with-aesop-player"
	onclick="gaLinkClick('FAQ getting-books')">FAQ</a>,
	or anywhere you happen to know of.
	For now, choose one that downloads whole books as zip files, which is most of them.
    </li>
    <li>
	Start your favorite Web browser on the device and navigate to that provider. Pick a book 
	you want to read and download it. For most browsers, take the defaults, but in any case 
	download the zip file into the Android default <code>Downloads</code> directory.
    </li>
    <li>
	Return to Aesop, then go to Settings (the "gear" icon) and click on the New Books
	button along the bottom edge of the Settings screen.
    </li>
    <li>
	You will be presented with a list of candidates that look roughly like book downloads to Aesop.
	Among them you should find the book you downloaded.
	Aesop will have tried to figure out the proper title and will display it.
	(If you have a lot of clutter in <code>Downloads</code>, be patient while Aesop digs through the clutter.)
    </li>
    <li>
	Click on the checkbox to the left of the entry for your new book, and then, 
	at the upper right, the INSTALL button. 
	(For now, be careful not to check on any of the clutter.)
    </li>
    <li>
	The Aesop player will display the names of the subfiles in the zip file as it unpacks 
	them. (Sometimes the zip file has them "in order", sometimes not. It doesn't matter.)
	The entry will disappear from <code>Downloads</code>. (See here
	<a href="install-configure.html#Provisioning">for why</a>.) 
    </li>
    <li>
	Return to the main Aesop screen and navigate (swipe left or right) to your new book.
    </li>

</ul>
