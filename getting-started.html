<h2>1. Requirements</h2>

<p>
You need a smartphone or a tablet running the Android 5.0 system or newer.
<br>
You can also run the app on Android 4.3+ and the Kindle Fire tablets but there
will be some limitations when making a dedicated player.
</p>

<p>
An internet connection is needed during installation but it is not necessary
when listening to audiobooks.
</p>

<h2>2. Install Homer Player</h2>

<p>
Open the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.studio4plus.homerplayer&referrer=utm_source%3Dwebsite%26utm_term%3Dtest"
	onclick="gaLinkClick('Play Store')">Play Store</a> app on your tablet,
search for "Homer Player" and tap "Install".
</p>
<p>
If your tablet doesn't have the Google Play Store (e.g. Kindle Fire), you can
download the installation APK file directly from <a
	href="https://goo.gl/XJhKX7" onclick="gaLinkClick('github
	releases')">https://goo.gl/XJhKX7</a>.
Open the downloaded file on your phone or tablet to install.
</p>

<h2>3. Open Homer Player</h2>

<p>
The first time you open Homer Player you may be prompted to choose a
Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine. Choose one (Google is a safe bet - this can be
changed later) and tap "Always".
</p>

<p>
You can download sample audiobook excerpts from within the app so that you can
start testing it right away.
</p>

<h2>4. Copy your audiobooks to the device</h2>

<p>First prepare the audiobooks on your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>The books must be in the form of MP3 files (DRM-free). You can get them
from <a href="faq.html#where-do-i-get-books-to-listen-to-with-homer-player"
onclick="gaLinkClick('FAQ getting-books')">stores and libraries (either online
downloads or on CDs)</a>.
<li>Each audiobook needs to be in its own folder. The folder name should be the
book title (it is displayed and read by the player).
<li>The files will be played in alphabetic order.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Then copy the folders with audiobooks to the tablet:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the tablet to your Mac or PC with a USB cable. If you're using a
Mac, you may need the <a href="https://www.android.com/filetransfer/">Android
file transfer tool</a>.
<li>Copy your audiobooks to the tablet. Put them inside the <code>AudioBooks</code>
folder. The folder should have been automatically created when the Homer Player
app was started for the first time.
</ol>
