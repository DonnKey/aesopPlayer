# Privacy Policy

By using the Aesop Player app (the "App") you can consent to the collection and
processing of data concerning your use of the App in accordance with this
privacy policy.

## Data collection and processing

The App optionally automatically collects certain usage and device data 
for the purpose of improving the App and its user experience.

During application initialization, or later from the main Settings screen,
you can authorize limited data collection. Assuming you have authorized 
it, the following data is collected when you use the App. If you have 
not authorized it, no data is collected or transmitted.

### Usage information

This includes but is not limited to information about how often the App is
being used or which application features are used, etc. This data contains
no personally identifiable information and it is processed by the third party
service Firebase Analytics (a part of Google). Only Firebase Analytics 
retains any of this information. User provided variable information (for
example, book titles) is never uploaded.

### Stability monitoring

This is data about application errors that cause the application to stop (so
called "crashes"). Whenever such an error occurs data about the application state
at that moment is collected. This data is processed by the third party service
Firebase Crashlytics (a part of Google). Only Firebase Crashlytics retains
any of this information. User provided variable information (for
example, book titles) is never uploaded.

### Device data

Both usage and stability monitoring collects data about the device on which the
application is running. The data includes but is not limited to make and model
of the device, technical specification such as screen resolution, amount of
memory and some state of the device, e.g. the current amount of free memory.

## Third party services

The data described above is collected, stored and processed with the use of the
following third party services:

- The general Google privacy policy is here: [Privacy Policy]( https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en&gl=us)
- We have been unable to find specific Privacy Policies related to Analytics and Crashlytics.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

The policy may be modified at any time. Any changes will be posted to this page.
