<h2>The why</h2>

<p>
Most audio players available on the market are created for young people and
their main function is playing music. They are small, have multiple functions
like shuffle, repeat, radio and even video playback.
</p>

<p>
All of these make them difficult or even impossible to operate by older, less
tech savvy people often struggling with poor eyesight. These people often want
to listen to audiobooks as an alternative to reading that becomes harder and
harder as their sight deteriorates.
</p>

<h2>The features</h2>

<p>
Homer Player is an Android application for playing audiobooks. With it's simple
user interface and unique features it is intended mainly for people with low
vision and the elderly.
</p>

<h3>Audio book support</h3>

<p>
Playback is geared towards audiobooks with folder-based navigation. The folder
name is the title.<br>
Subfolders are treated as part of the same book (useful for books that come on
multiple CDs).
</p>

<h3>Resume where stopped</h3>

<p>
Playback is resumed where you have left off. And with the jump back feature it
actually goes back 15s earlier to remind you the last sentence or two.<br>
The position is stored for each book separately so you can safely switch between
several books.
</p>

<h3>Low vision friendly interface</h3>

<p>
Book titles are read out loud when browsing.<br>
The buttons are large and with high contrast.
</p>

<h3>"Easy stop"</h3>

<p>
There's no need to press any buttons to stop playback&mdash;just put the device
down on a level surface with the screen down.
</p>

<h3>Single application mode (kiosk mode)</h3>

<p>
With the kiosk mode enabled the user's actions are confined to the application
and no other functions of the device are available.
</p>

<p>
This way a multipurpose tablet can be converted into a simple to use, single
purpose audiobook player. The other functions of the device don't become a
distraction to the user.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="/install-dedicated.html">Making a dedicated player</a> for
instructions on enabling the kiosk mode.
