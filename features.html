<h2>The Why</h2>

<p>
Most audio players available on the market are created for young people and
their main function is playing music. They have a small screen, have multiple functions
like shuffle, repeat, radio and even video playback.
</p>

<p>
All of these features make the popular players hard to use for the elderly.
Especially if they struggle with poor eyesight and their motor skills aren't
as good as they used to be. Yet for many seniors listening to audiobooks
becomes an alternative to reading, which gets harder and harder as their sight
deteriorates.
</p>

<p>They need a suitable tool.</p>

<p>
So do people who simply want to listen to books without technical distractions and the
incorrect assumptions made by "music" players.
They can use Aesop with only those features they find useful enabled. 
(If you're one of the people who just wants a simple book player, please don't feel
unwelcome because of the focus on the elderly and others who need special features.
If The Aesop Player works for you, we're happy to have you along.)
</p>

<h2>Why a phone or tablet?</h2>
<p>
Fumbling with physical CDs and a "boom-box" isn't always practical, and dedicated
players with many controls and dedicated media formats can be intimidating; most 
are fairly large, making them difficult for elders to carry. The older small
"music players" were exactly that, music players, not audiobook players.
</p>
<p>
Phones and tablets ("devices") are small and light, and thus easily portable; they fit 
easily in a pocket, or in a walker's "goodie bag". 
Most devices can easily store a dozen or more complete books, which is much more convenient than
boxes of CDs, and there's no need to change the CDs as the book progresses.
</p>
<p>
There are lots of old, unused, Smart Phones (and tablets) sitting in drawers around
the world.  These can be repurposed to become convenient Dedicated audiobook players.
Small screens don't matter if they aren't being read.
</p>

<h2>The features</h2>

<p>
The Aesop Player is an Android application for playing audiobooks. With it's simple
(and tactile) user interface and a unique set of features it is intended mainly for people
with low vision and for the elderly.
</p>

<p>
The Aesop Player works on older phones (back to 4.2.x (API 17)), and does not require
a SIM card (does not need to be connected to the cellular network).
</p>

<h3>Audio book support</h3>

<p>
Playback is geared towards audiobooks with folder-based navigation. 
The folder name controls the title.
Subfolders are treated as part of the same book (useful for books that come on
multiple CDs). Book titles are announced audibly.
</p>

<h3>Resume where stopped</h3>

<p>
Playback is resumed where you have left off. And with the jump back feature it
actually goes back (by a selectable time) to remind you the last sentence or two.<br>
The position is stored for each book separately so you can safely switch between
several books.
</p>

<p>
Volume and speed levels are also retained between player sessions so it isn't necessary
to reconfigure the device if it is used for other purposes.
</p>

<h3>Low vision friendly interface</h3>

<p>
Book titles are read out loud when browsing; swipe left and right to change
the book.<br>
The buttons are very large and with high contrast. (They are large enough that
(even limited) touch alone is enough.)
</p>

<h3>Flip-to-stop</h3>

<p>
There's no need to press any buttons to stop playback&mdash;just put the device
on a level surface with its screen down. Optionally, resume playback by flipping it
back face-up.
</p>

<h3>Sleep timer</h3>

<p>
Playback can be paused automatically after a configured time (e.g. 10 minutes) so
that the book doesn't play the whole night when the listener falls asleep.<br>
Shake the device to extend the timer.
</p>

<h3>Adjust speed</h3>

<p>Slow down playback for those who are hard of hearing or need more time to
understand speech (e.g. after a stroke). Speed up playback for those who find
some performers tediously slow (or who are just "in a hurry to find out how it 
turns out").
</p>

<h3>Alternative Volume and Speed Controls</h3>
<p>
The volume and speed can be adjusted via controls designed for low-vision and
low-tactile-ability users that provide audio-feedback on how the adjustment is proceeding.
</p>

<h3>Dedicated Player mode (kiosk mode)</h3>

<p>
With the Dedicated Player (kiosk) mode enabled the user's actions are confined to Aesop
and no other functions of the device are available.
</p>

<p>
This way a multipurpose device can be converted into a simple to use, single
purpose audiobook player. The other functions of the device don't become a
distraction to the user.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="install-dedicated.html">Making a dedicated player</a> for
instructions on enabling a Dedicated Player.
</p>

<h3>Provisioning</h3>
<p>
Although adding and deleting books is not inherently difficult, depending on circumstances
it can become tedious and time-consuming. Aesop Player has features that make this
much less tedious, and which can be used via various remote-access services to allow the
player to get new books without having to touch the physical device.
</p>

<h2 id="roles" class="anchor-target">Roles - setting up the device</h2>
<p>
The focus of the Aesop Player is on users who would not typically be able to
set up the device themselves.
That implies that someone else will be involved in setting up the device, and who
will need to occasionally return to it to change books or adjust settings to match the 
needs of the user.
</p>
<p>
We will, for clarity, assume that there are three roles involved in using the Aesop player: 
<ul>
    <li>the user (who may have physical limitations such as touch or vision limitations), 
    <li>a care-giver who is not a computer expert (but probably has their own smart phone), 
	but who interacts with the user very frequently,
    <li>a technical person.
</ul>
A single person could fill more than one of these roles, but this separation makes explanations easier.
The technical person needs to be able to use a smart phone fully,
and if Full Kiosk mode is needed, have access to a PC (or Mac).
<br>
Depending on how Provisioning is done, it may require a technical person or a very computer-aware care-giver 
to change the book selection.
See 
<a href="#provisioning">Provisioning</a>
for details on installing books and to understand that requirement.

<p>
The Aesop Player is an outgrowth of the

; 
Aesop Player would not exisit without Homer Player, and they share a lot of features and documentation. 
A big Thank You to Marcin Siminoides for making this possible.
