Homer Player is an Android application for playing audio books. With it's simple
user interface and unique features it is intended mainly for people with low
vision and the elderly.
</p>

<h3>Audio book support</h3>

<p>
Playback is geared towards audio books with folder-based navigation. The folder
name is the title.<br>
Subfolders are treated as part of the same book (useful for books that come on
multiple CDs).
</p>

<h3>Resume where stopped</h3>

<p>
Playback is resumed where you have left off. And with the jump back feature it
actually goes back 15s earlier to remind you the last sentence or two.<br>
The position is stored for each book separately so you can safely switch between
several books.
</p>

<h3>Low vision friendly UI</h3>

<p>
Book titles are read out loud when browsing.<br>
The buttons are large and with high contrast.
</p>

<h3>"Easy stop"</h3>

<p>
There's no need to press any buttons to stop playback&mdash;just put the device
down on a level surface with the screen down.
</p>

<h3>Single application mode (kiosk mode)</h3>

<p>
With the kiosk mode enabled the user's actions are confined to the application
and no other functions of the device are available.
</p>

<p>
This way a multipurpose tablet can be converted into a simple to use, single
purpose audio book player. The other functions of the device don't become a
distraction to the user.
</p>

<p>
See <a href="/install-dedicated.html">Making a dedicated player</a> for
instructions on enabling the kiosk mode.
