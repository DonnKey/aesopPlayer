<p>
Now that Aesop Player is installed on your tablet (see <a
href="getting-started.html">Getting started</a>) it's time to fine-tune the
configuration to match the user.
</p>

<p>
Some considerations before you start:
<ul>
    <li>
	If you're "just playing" to learn, you can simply start playing with the settings.
    <li>
	If you intend to use Aesop as just another application on your phone,
	you might find some of the settings useful.
    <li>
    	If you are creating a player for another user you'll want to look into creating a 
	<a href="install-dedicated.html">Dedicated Player</a>
	and you'll also want (even if you don't use all the Dedicated Player features)
	to read the material about security at the beginning of the Dedicated Player section.
    <li>Adding new books is discussed under
	<a href="provisioning.html">Managing Books</a>
</ul>

<h2 id="accessing-settings" class="anchor-target">Accessing Settings</h2>
<p>
When Aesop is first installed, you can access its settings by simply tapping the Settings ("gear") icon.
Since one of the objectives of Aesop is simplicity for users with physical limitations, accidentally
and unexpectedly entering Settings mode is not desirable. 
One of the settings discussed in detail in the Dedicated Player section is 
<a href="install-dedicated.html#access-to-settings">Settings Mode Access Interlock</a>.
It changes what must be done to access Settings mode.
If the interlock is enabled, when you tap the settings icon there will be popups on the screen 
guiding you on what needs to be done to access settings.
</p>
<p>
Look also at
<a href="install-dedicated.html#maintenance-mode">Maintenance Mode</a>
if you expect to be temporarily entering and exiting Settings frequently.
</p>

<h2 id="configure-ui-features" class="anchor-target">Configure User Interface Features</h2>
<p>
Once you have entered Settings (above), you'll see an Android Settings screen. Besides
the Playback Settings (a sub-screen) you'll see several items, each discussed below.
These are either on/off or radio buttons.
<p>
Some of the features exist to make the device easier to use for certain users. Individual 
users will have different limitations, and thus customizing these settings may help them
better use Aesop.
<h3 id="button-delay" class="anchor-target">Button Delay</h3>
<p>
Button Delay desensitizes the Start and Stop functions for a selectable interval after they
are tapped. For users with shaky hands, this keeps accidental presses from being interpreted
as additional presses of the buttons. A countdown (in seconds) is displayed for the longer
delays. The default is "Normal", which is 2 seconds.
<h3 id="blink-speed" class="anchor-target">Blink Speed</h3>
Some users can see motion or change where they can't perceive a static image. This
setting causes the Start and Stop buttons to blink their text. The default is "Normal", 
a sedate but noticeable blink rate.
<h3 id="awake-proximity" class="anchor-target">Awaken on Proximity Detector</h3>
The display is by far the largest drain on the battery, so it's a good idea to set a short
display timeout when running on battery.
However some users find the light from the display helpful, so with this
feature enabled, the display will light when the user passes a hand near the device, no tap
is required.
<h3>Screen Orientation</h3>
Aesop always uses a "landscape" (horizontal) layout on user screens.
The default of "Landscape Auto" is usually
what's needed - it will align itself to the orientation of the device. The display can also be 
locked into either of the two possible landscape alignments, which is particularly useful
on devices with smart covers, so the display aligns with the cover conveniently.

<h2 id="configure-playback-features" class="anchor-target">Configure Playback Features</h2>
<p>
Aesop Player offers several settings that allow useful customization such as playback
speed, volume, sleep timer and the like on this sub-screen.

<h3 id="jump-back" class="anchor-target">Jump Back When Resuming Playback</h3>
When playback is paused or stopped, it's easy to lose context of the story.
Aesop will automatically back up 5, 15, 30 or 45 seconds (default is 5) when restarting.

<h3 id="sleep-timer" class="anchor-target">Sleep Timer</h3>
It's easy to fall asleep while listening to a story. You can have Aesop stop playing (and fade
out, not just stop) after a selectable interval between 30 seconds and 20 minutes.
The timer is reset each time the device is shaken enough.
This works nicely with the jump back feature.

<h3>Playback Speed</h3>
This is an alternative (but somewhat limited) access to the Playback Speed setting discussed
<a href="user-interface.html#playback-speed">here</a>.
Short snippets of the current book will be played for each speed 
(the book position will not change).

<h3 id="volume-speed" class="anchor-target">Adjust Volume and Speed Switches</h3>
These are used to enable or disable the volume and speed controls that can be used while
a book is playing. They are discussed in detail
<a href="user-interface.html#playback-volume-speed">here</a>.

<h3 id="face-down" class="anchor-target">Pause on Face Down</h3>
Playback, once started, can be paused or stopped by turning the device face-down, which is an easy
gesture to learn. If this presents a problem, it can be disabled here.
</p>
Many users also find it nice to be able to resume playback by turning the device face-up again
(if it was stopped by turning it face-down). That option is also enabled here.

<h3>Fast-forward/rewind sound</h3>
The sound associated with using the fast-forward and rewind feature can be disabled here if
the sound is irritating.

<h2 id="android-settings" class="anchor-target">Android System Settings</h2>
<p>
There are also several settings for the Android System that affect the use of Aesop.
These are discussed below. Unfortunately, various Android releases, and Android vendor
customizations, cause the exact process of changing specific settings to be different on different
devices. These descriptions are "typical". Many Android systems offer a "Search" option (with
a magnifying glass) to search settings if you can't easily find where the provider has
put a specific setting.
</p>
<p>
The section on creating a Dedicated Player talks about the setting specific to that.
</p>

<h3 id="easy-switch-on" class="anchor-target">Easy switch on</h3>

<p>
The screen-on buttons on the side of tablets are usually quite small and may be
difficult to locate and press by people with poor vision or motor skills.
</p>

<p>
There are several other ways to switch the screen on. The availability of
each option depends on the device's sensors and available accessories, so you
need to figure out what's best.

<dl style="PADDING-LEFT: 2em">
    Proximity Detector 
    <dd>The Aesop feature to use the Proximity Detector to turn on the screen
        is a simple solution presuming the device has a Proximity Detector. Most
	devices have at least some capability since it also is used to turn off the screen
	when using the device as a phone.</dd>
    "Smart" cover
    <dd>A "smart" cover is a cover that enables the screen when it's open. It
	usually requires support from the tablet itself. The screen orientation may be
	locked in Aesop Player settings to align with the cover.</dd>
    Double-tap screen-off gesture
    <dd>Some devices offer screen-off gestures; they can be configured to switch on
	after double-tapping the screen.</dd>
    Tactile Home button
    <dd>Some devices, notably those from Samsung, have a tactile Home button at the
	front below the screen. This button may be easier to use than the power
	button.</dd>
</dl>

Choose the best available method of switching the screen on so that the
device is easy to use.
</p>

<h3 id="disable-wifi-to-preserve-battery" class="anchor-target">Disable WiFi to preserve battery</h3>

<p>Aesop Player doesn't need Internet access while playing books.
However, it does need Internet access when downloading books, if you do that (see 
<a href="#managing-books">Managing Books</a>
for details). 
WiFi (or cellular) access is also needed if remotely controlling the device.
<p>
If WiFi or cellular is not needed, you can disable WiFi and cellular connection (in phones) so that 
the battery lasts longer.</p>
<p>
The easiest way to disable cellular is probably to enable the "airplane mode". Many devices will allow you to
re-enable WiFi after entering "airplane mode", if you need WiFi but not cellular.</p>
