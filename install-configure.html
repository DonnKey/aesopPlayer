Now that Aesop Player is installed on your tablet (see <a
href="getting-started.html">Getting started</a>) it's time to fine-tune the
configuration to make a simple audiobook player.

</ol>

<h2 id="configure-playback-features" class="anchor-target">Configure playback features</h2>

<p>
Aesop Player offers several settings that allow useful customization: playback
speed may be decreased for those hard of hearing, sleep timer may be set up to
automatically pause after a short time of inactivity and so on.
</p>

<p>
Open Aesop Player and tap the screen 5 times to enter the Settings screen.
</p>

<h2 id="disable-lock-screen" class="anchor-target">Disable the lock screen</h2>

<p>
In an audio player the lock screen is just an impediment. Let's disable it so
that when the screen is switched on the apps are displayed right away.
</p>

<div class="additional-info info"><strong>Kindle Fire:</strong>
There is no way to disable the lock screen on a Kindle Fire. Setting it to
"Swipe" is the best that can be done.
</div>

<p>
Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &rarr; <strong>Lock screen</strong> &rarr;
<strong>Screen lock</strong> and choose <strong>None</strong>.
</p>

<img class="center-block img-responsive" src="img/disable-lock.png">

<div class="additional-info info">The <strong>None</strong> option not
available? See the
<a href="faq.html#i-want-to-disable-screen-lock-on-my-device-but-the-none-option-is-not-available">FAQ</a>
for solutions.</div>

<h2 id="easy-switch-on" class="anchor-target">Easy switch on</h2>

<p>
The screen on buttons on the side of tablets are usually quite small and may be
difficult to locate and press by people with poor vision or motor skills.
</p>

<p>
There are several other ways for switching the screen on. The availability of
each option depends on the device's sensors and available accessories so you
need to figure out what's best.

<dl>
<dt>"Smart" cover</dt>
<dd>a "smart" cover is a cover that enables the screen when it's open. It
usually requires support from the tablet itself. The screen orientation may be
locked in Aesop Player settings to align with the cover.</dd>
<dt>Double-tap screen-off gesture</dt>
<dd>some devices offer screen-off gestures, they can be configured to switch on
after double-tapping the screen.</dt>
<dt>Wave to switch on</dt>
<dd>there are apps that switch the screen on when they detect a hand being
swiped over the priximity sensor. They often work with regular, non-smart
covers as well. The device needs to be equipped with a proximity sensor.
<dt>Tactile Home button</dt>
<dd>some devices, notably those from Samsung, have a tactile Home button at the
front below the screen. This button may be easier to use than the power
button.</dd>
</dl>

Configure the best available method of swiching the screen on so that the
device is easy to use.
</p>

<h2 id="disable-wifi-to-preserve-battery" class="anchor-target">Disable WiFi to preserve battery</h2>

<p>Aesop Player doesn't need Internet access therefore you can disable WiFi and
cellular connection (in phones) so that the battery lasts longer.</p>

<p>The easiest way is probably to enable the "airplane mode".</p>

<h2 id="enable-kiosk-mode" class="anchor-target">Enable the "kiosk" mode</h2>

<p>
To make a simple audio player all the apps and Android functionality need to
be hidden so that they don't confuse the non-tech-savvy user. This is achieved
by hiding the system bars and making it difficult to leave the Aesop Player
application.<br>
This is called a "kiosk mode".
</p>

<div class="center-block photo" style="max-width: 420px">
<img class="img-responsive" src="img/gallery/kiosk mode.png">
Kiosk mode hides Android system bars and apps.
</div>

<div class="additional-info info"><strong>Two kiosk modes:</strong>
the app provides two types of kiosk mode. The simple mode has some flaws but
is easy to enable and is described below; the full kiosk mode is more robust
but is also more difficult to set up.<br>
See <a href="install-full-kiosk.html">the full kiosk mode</a> for more info
(you can skip this step and go for the full mode right away).</div>

<p>Enabling the simple kiosk mode requires several steps:</p>

<p>
Open Aesop Player &rarr; tap the screen 5 times &rarr; <strong>Prevent exiting
the application (kiosk mode)</strong> &rarr; enable the <strong>Simple
mode...</strong> &rarr; choose <strong>Aesop Player</strong> at the prompt that
shows up.
</p>

<p>
Notice that the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen is hidden.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Swipe your finger up</strong> from below the edge of the screen. The
navigation bar shows up.<br>
Now tap the <strong>&bigcirc; (Home) button</strong>. The tablet will again
show a prompt asking which app to use to complete the action. You need to
choose <strong>Aesop Player</strong> and tap <strong>Always</strong>.
</p>

<div class="center-block img-responsive video-poster">
<a href="https://youtube.com/embed/ivu9EeZ2qHA?vq=hd720&autoplay=1&autohide=1&border=0&egm=0&showinfo=0"
    data-event-label="simple-kiosk-mode" class="overlay"><i
      class="fa fa-play-circle fa-5x"></i></a>
<img class="img-responsive" src="img/simple-kiosk-mode-poster.png">
</div>

<p>
Now when the tablet is switched on or resterted it will go directly to Aesop
Player.
</p>

<div class="additional-info info"><strong>Kindle Fire:</strong> There is no
easy way to set Aesop Player as the home app on a Kindle Fire. The steps above
don't work fully as expected.</div>

<p>
The regular behaviour is restored by disabling the kiosk mode in Aesop Player
settings.
</p>
