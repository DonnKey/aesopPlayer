<h2>The why</h2>

<p>
Most audio players available on the market are created for young people and
their main function is playing music. They are small, have multiple features
like shuffle, repeat, radio and even video playback.
</p>

<p>
All of these make them difficult or even impossible to operate by older, less
tech savvy people often struggling with poor eyesight. These people often want
to listen to audio books as an alternative to reading that becomes harder and
harder as their sight deteriorates.
</p>

<h2>The goal</h2>

<p>
Homer Player is a project that aims at turning a regular Android tablet into a
dedicated audio book player that can be easily used by visually impaired and
elderly people.
</p>

<p>
The Homer Player application is created to run as the only application
available to the user. This way all the other functions of the device don't
become a distraction. It provides only the most basic features needed to play
audio books.
</p>

<p>
With this application a multipurpose tablet can be converted into a simple to
use, single purpose audio book player.
</p>

<h2>The assumptions</h2>

<p>Homer Player is created with the following assumptions in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>focused on audio book playback, not music,
<li>used at home,
<li>controlled with imprecise gestures and subject to accidental touch,
<li>the user can see but isn't able to make out letters or small UI controls,
<li>the device serves only a single function (no access to other applications).
</ul>
